# Parameterized-radom-generator
A generator which consume coefficients for each result. Coefficients can be generated by 'config's which describes math functions

## Example
Let's suppose we need a random generator, which generate one of 5 items with prpbability depending on their index and the 
last item must be generated in 10 times more often then the first:
```
1 - 1
2 - ?
3 - ?
4 - ?
5 - 10
```
In the other words we need a random generator, which destribution can be described by linear function and have enough information
to describe the function.

To create the genertor we should write this code:
```cpp
    #define FIRST_ITEM_CHANCE 1
    #define LAST_ITEM_CHANCE 10
    #define ITEMS_COUNT 5

    auto configuration = std::make_unique<LinearConfiguration>();
    configuration->way_1(FIRST_ITEM_CHANCE, LAST_ITEM_CHANCE, ITEMS_COUNT);
    CoeffGenerator generator(std::move(configuration));
```

The same code in short syntax:
```cpp
    CoeffGenerator generator(std::unique_ptr<LinearConfiguration>((new LinearConfiguration())->way_1(FIRST_ITEM_CHANCE, LAST_ITEM_CHANCE, ITEMS_COUNT)));
```


## Deployment
Just include the generator to your project with this Cmake line:
```cmake
target_link_libraries (your.out ParameterizedRadomGenerator)
```
